# Episode 002: 10 Things That Keep You Alive While Scuba Diving

Yo, what's up! Welcome back. I'm Claude, and today we're diving into 10 things that keep you alive while scuba diving.

Scuba diving opens up an incredible underwater world, but it demands absolute respect for safety protocols. These ten rules aren't suggestions - they're life-or-death fundamentals that every diver must internalize.
The most dangerous thing you can do underwater is hold your breath while ascending. As you rise, decreasing pressure causes air in your lungs to expand. Holding your breath can cause lung over-expansion injuries, arterial gas embolism, or pneumothorax. Always breathe continuously and never, ever hold your breath.
Rapid ascents are a leading cause of decompression sickness. Follow the rule: ascend no faster than 30 feet per minute, and always make a 3-5 minute safety stop at 15-20 feet, even on no-decompression dives. Your computer or tables are guides, but slow ascents are always safer.
Check your pressure gauge every few minutes. Follow the rule of thirds: use one-third of your air going out, one-third coming back, and keep one-third in reserve. Never ignore low air warnings, and always surface with at least 500 PSI remaining.
Advanced wrecks, deep dives, and overhead environments require specific training. Pushing beyond your certification level isn't brave - it's deadly. Get proper training before attempting new dive types, and gain experience gradually.
Good buoyancy protects both you and the reef. Uncontrolled ascents cause injuries, while crashing into the bottom damages equipment and marine life. Practice buoyancy skills regularly, use proper weighting, and fine-tune throughout the dive.
Every dive needs a plan: maximum depth, bottom time, air limits, and emergency procedures. Communicate the plan with your buddy, and stick to it. Spontaneous decisions underwater often lead to accidents.
The buddy system saves lives. Your buddy can provide air, assist with problems, and call for help in emergencies. Stay close enough to help but not so close you interfere. Regularly check on each other and review hand signals.
Equipment failures underwater can be fatal. Service regulators annually, inspect gear before every dive, and carry backup safety equipment. A well-maintained BCD, regulator, and dive computer are essential for safe diving.
Practice emergency ascents, air-sharing, and rescue skills until they're automatic. Know how to handle equipment failures, buddy separation, and medical emergencies. Regular skills practice keeps these procedures sharp when you need them most.
Never dive when sick, tired, stressed, or under the influence. Diving requires clear judgment and physical capability. Know your limits, be honest about your condition, and don't let peer pressure override safety concerns.
These rules aren't restrictions - they're freedoms that let you explore safely for decades. Respect the underwater environment, respect your limits, and always prioritize safety over any dive objective. The best dive is one where everyone returns safely to the surface.

That's a wrap!
